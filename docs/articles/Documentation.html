<p>Firstly it asks us is to supply a table in markdown format with some
basic information about the packages. We can copy this from the output
message from the <code>checkDependencies</code> function.</p>
<p>Then it asks us to give a description as to why we would like these

<p>Finally, we can add some additional information if required.</p>

vector of packages to be excluded. By default is empty.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>package_types</strong> default (c(“imports”, “depends”)):
Package dependency types to be included. By default imports and depends
are included. Availible types are: <strong>1</strong>)

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<p><u>Dependency Graph</u></p>
The Dependency Graph tab displays a graph, like plotted earlier, using
the <code>graphData</code> function. On the right-hand-side different
kinds of dependencies are able to be chosen to be included in the graph.
<div class="figure">

<p><u>Path to dependency</u></p>
<p>The path to dependency tab displays how the root package depends on
any recursive dependency.</p>
On the right-hand-side a dependency found somewhere included in the root
package can be chosen. A cutoff can be defined to limit the distance
from the root package to the chosen dependency.
